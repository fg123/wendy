# WendyScript C Interpreter
## Language and Interpreter created by Felix Guo

The syntax for WendyScript can be found at [feliguo.me](http://felixguo.me/wendy).

The repository is a WendyScript interpreter written in C. 

The interpreter can be built by using the build.sh file found in the /src folder.

> ./build.sh

This script will run a `make clean`, `make` as well as execute a variety of input-output tests in the /tests folder.
This ensures the build of WendyScript works as intended.
